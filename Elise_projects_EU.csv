Positium positions itself between the mobile network operator and the client.,Out of 42 market segments; the project identified 3 highest potential market segment for mobile positioning data statistics usage - mobility; tourism; population analytics.,NA,Mobile positioning data has a number of limitations and we have spent years finding solutions for each one of them. Not everyone uses a mobile phone. Some people own several. There may also be disparities due to the gender gap in mobile phone ownership; especially in low- and middle-income countries; and disparities between different socio-economic groups. Additionally; it is only phone users who are subscribed to or roaming in the mobile network which is providing the data who will be included in the dataset. The geographic; demographic; and socio-economic distribution of each mobile network operator is likely to be different and should be accounted for with appropriate methods. There is noise in the data. To address these concerns; we have developed various solutions that are included in our flagship product; Positium Data Mediator. The core of the methodology is the continuity model; which is the representation of people�s spatio-temporal activity with a semantic domain-specific interpretation of the behaviour of the subscribers. The continuity model allows sophisticated queries and analysis possibilities that are incorporated into the automatic results generation of PDM.,There are now some use cases online for Postium applying this technology e.g. a new data-driven bus route launched in Tartu (city in South Estonia,https://positium.com/research/methodology

The availability of video data was a significant achievement since there were multiple legal and technical difficulties that had to be overcome.,The project delivered one final prototype to each one of the cities that participated in the project as an end user. The VaVeL system; installed at the premises of Dublin City and Warsaw City is a fully operational smart city monitoring system focusing on dealing with emergencies; improving public transport as well as providing better services to the citizens. The two use cases we have developed are complementary and serve as the vehicle to first understand the needs of users and state-holders and subsequently evaluate the proposed solutions in a realistic environment. Complementarity different data sources; provide a different view of events or aspects of the urban environment.,The consortium has made significant progress working in close collaboration with the use partners: Dublin City and the City of Warsaw. Together with the research and industry partners; they developed a detailed set of requirements; resolved data issues; designed the architecture; and built two working prototypes.,"Diversity; multi-modality urban streams are diverse and heterogeneous not only in content; but also in format and degree of granularity; with different scales in space and time; and from sources with different levels of trust. In Dublin; the city was using a different standard for underlying map coordinates so the project team had to create Open Street Map data layer.

 Machine learning and data mining algorithms can be hindered by the lack of ground truth knowledge which makes understanding of the data difficult.

Constraints and Cost: urban streams are oftentimes constrained; meaning that access to them might be limited. 

Design of monitoring system required privacy to be designed into the system from the outset. ",The technologies developed in VaVeL have been designed to be applicable in many situations and cities with minimum adaptation costs; thus facilitating their deployment in other municipalities and contexts (replicability),

This solution is based on data gathered through sensors located in the urban area in order to prevent risks which have an impact on buildings; improve energy consumption and control tourism mass. The project is based on the use of ITC and heritage expertise. Its first stage focuses on buildings and will be extended then to urban settings.  Pedestrian counting cameras designed and installed that enable policy makers to understand visitor flows and avoid overcrowding or underuse of heritage sites and locations in the Historic City of Avila. 

SH CITY provides an open source tool to manage historic urban complexes and support the competent authorities in making decisions regarding the conservation of the historic complex; its maintenance and its sustainable tourism development. To this end; the project has developed a first pilot in the city of �vila and collects data from the historical complex it processes to analyse the elements of risk that affect buildings as well as their energy consumption and the flow of visitors. It is based on a network of sensors that measure environmental and structural parameters in real time. This information is treated and converted to indicators that are published in two software tools. As a result; a self-diagnostic web tool generates wealth management recommendations that allow managers to intervene. On the other hand; the project has a mobile application for tourists and citizens that offers routes designed based on occupancy indicators; people flows; schedules; gauging and events.",NA,A common di_culty of the above data sources is that it is usually di_cult or even impossible to distinguish between local and tourist tra_c. This is where integrating road tra_c data with additional data sources and sensors can prove highly valuable.

As noted by the team working on the project; across the public sector; there are persistent data gaps that have impeded policy making; particularly when it comes to big data. They identify two major challenges that need to be addressed (i) data literacy; helping policy makers outside of specialist data teams appreciate the benefits and risks of geographic information; and (ii) advanced technology; policymakers require easy to use tools to extract trusted intelligence from data. In order to address these challenges; the project has developed interactive and customizable maps; 3D maps and story-telling visualizations to support more intuitive and collaborative data decision policy making.,NA,Challenge of making big data analysis available and understandable for policy makers and for engaging the public in decision making,In PoliVisu�s pilot cities; there is increased awareness of the benefits of data visualisations for more collaborative and effective policy making. So much so; cities are starting to think about including this approach in their charters.

It adapts the routes to the individual user taking into account their daily routines to provide personalized recommendations; such as information about bus lines and stops; status of traffic and queues; bus schedules; car sharing; bicycle renting; and others; all in real-time.

The key features of CityDash are:

a dashboard that enables the visualisation of real-time information;
time-series indicator data and interactive maps about all aspects of the city; such as city traffic flow; people movements; cars; bus fleets; location of citizens connected to the mobile app; �;
a video map showing citizen movements during the previous day; among other features.","CityGO is a mobile application; which indicates to the user what public transport options are available at any time for a particular route. For instance; it suggests options such as electric car sharing; buses; the nearest public bike rental station; available parking spaces; etc. Everything is managed in real time to obtain an optimal route based on data provided by the sensor network and open data from the city. This is invaluable to the citizen and the visitor and also indicates accessibility and other useful information to move in the city.

CityDash is a Web-based dashboard for the municipal control centre; which allows civil servants to visualise all data coming from the city sensor network to support everyday decision making and evidence-informed analysis to improve the traffic planning in the city in times of high tourist flows; sport events and so on. ",Smart Citizens - Many smart city projects struggle to engage the citizens and community that the project has been designed to benefit. This was not the case in Malaga; where the benefits of CityGO made engagement simple and there has been a good take-up of the app,"Heterogeneity - the data were disparate and needed to be homogenized to build a comprehensive overview of the city and how to navigate it;
Lack of an appropriate toolset - There is no off-the-shelf solution yet for homogenising smart city data; so this had to be built for the project to succeed;
Legislation - Any personal data received from citizens were subject to GDPR. The risks associated with privacy were avoided by anonymizing the data;
Open Access - This was a major challenge. While the municipality and other stakeholders were generally happy to share data; some entities regarded their data as proprietary with the potential to monetise it; and had to be persuaded to share it for the benefit of the community. It is expected that any companies who have not yet participated will join in as they see the popularity of the app growing.
 ",Smart City - The municipality also appreciates the insights that the CityDash platform delivers with respect to urban mobility; and is exploring other areas of city oversight that can benefit from such platform; Future Potential - The CityGO and CityDash can clearly be used in other cities to achieve similar results.,http://www.city-go.eu/content/solution

Objective of the project is to make a comparative analysis of different methodologies for Energy Performance Labelling of buildings; applied to sample datasets of buildings of DE; NL and ES and to make the results of the comparative analysis re-usable in other geographical areas (Member States) by parties aiming to assess the energy performance labels of their building stock and interested to preliminary assess costs & benefits of applying the same (or similar) methodologies based on the availability of similar datasets; with respect to those used in the comparative analysis.,,"n particular; predictions of the heat demand at building level for an entire district or city could provide valuable support to different types of stakeholders involved in the energy efficiency policy cycle. These predictions are however affected by the lack of standardized calculation methodologies and of harmonized and interoperable building data needed to perform energy simulations. The ultimate drawback is represented by the poor comparability of the predictions; caused by different calculation methodologies; input building data of different accuracy; heterogeneous encoding of input/output data and different ways of represent/visualize output data.

Despite the availability of 3D city models as open data is increasing; information required by the energy simulations such as building age is often available only under restricted conditions.

The preparation of the 3D building data as input data for the energy simulations require the use of software tools which in turn require skilled people.

When comparing energy simulations with real energy consumption data; it is important to highlight that energy simulations do not consider user behaviours; as well as possible energy efficiency interventions made on (parts of) the simulated buildings; which instead have a strong impact on the energy consumption.","Finally; several mapping exercises between CityGML and�INSPIRE�data models available for 3D Buildings have been executed and documented; improving the�interoperability�of input and/or output datasets of the simulations.

The streaming features of the message streaming system allows  components to subscribe to data events. It also facilitates quick access to data in the case of responsive digital twin scenarios where data needs to be kept ready for use in models and/or visualizations. One of the most essential tasks of a digital twin system such as DUET is to enable the combination of different data sources to use them in (simulation) models or visualizations. More often than not; data sources are not fully compliant with known standards. And even if they do; it may not be the standard the user was hoping for; but a competing one. Thus; integrating data sources from different suppliers remains non-trivial. The DUET architecture should allow use case designers and users to deal with that.,"DUET is an Innovation project designed to leverage the advanced capabilities of cloud and high-performance computing (HPC) to evolve the traditional public policy making cycle using large open data sources. The aim is to help public sector decision-making become more democratic and effective; both in the short and long term; through the development and use of Digital Twins for policy impact exploration and experimentation in entire cities and regions. These digital replicas of a cities system will
(a) enhance day-to-day city management by helping city managers react quickly to real-time events through rapid experimentation of different decision impacts; and
(b) ensure longer term policy decisions are more effective and trusted by enabling city managers from different units; to explore and discuss with citizens and businesses city issues in a visual; easy-to-digest way via a common view.",,Cities are struggling to unlock value from their data due to a myriad of factors including; lack of data quality; consistency; accuracy; coverage; freshness; and completeness; plus a lack of data understanding (data literacy) to enable meaningful interpretation of data. Aside from the data itself; an overreliance on traditional analytics techniques; and lack of an infrastructure with the needed processing power to analyse the volume and variety of city data fast enough has also hampered progress. DUET helps cities address these challenges by providing access to the needed computing power; by making data easier to understand; and by establishing ethical principles for data driven decisions. Cloud computing has not been used for high performance computing to the same degree as other use cases for several reasons; namely cost. DUET will advance this area by providing a new shared approach for its use in policy making and city management using a Digital Twin. The Digital Twin infrastructure with its deep-dive visualisation platform for policy experimentation will boost collaboration and policy innovation and bring new discoveries and intelligence through novel views of the data. Moreover; Digital Twin provides one version/replica of the city for all to use as a trusted baseline for exploring systemic impact of decisions.,Attempts to define standards for constructing a digital twin have been made previously. However; there is still a gap in the literature particularly as regards unified models and interactions of data fusions for the physical and virtual data exchange. This is especially the case with new domains (e.g. smart city) where the digital twin paradigm has started to take hold only recently. To fill this gap; DUET will develop a framework for digital city twins.

Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs; extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities; and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. New LandSense services (LandSense Campaigner; FarmLand Support; Change Detector and Quality Assurance & Control) will be deployed in three demonstration cases that will address critical LULC issues in the areas of urbanization; agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring.,Policy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. There will be numerous pathways to citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform; i.e. tools for discussion; online voting collaborative mapping; as well as events linked to various campaigns involving public consultation.,Currently within the EU�s Earth Observation (EO) monitoring framework; there is a need for low-cost methods for acquiring high quality in-situ data to create accurate and well-validated environmental monitoring products.,LandSense delivered concrete; measurable and quality assured results that complement existing EO monitoring systems and can be seen as extending the in-situ component of the GEOSS and Copernicus initiatives. LandSense conducted seven demonstration pilots across seven countries across 3 domains. The pilots engaged some 1500 volunteers; who collected more than 10;000 in-situ observations and contributed to 725;000 EO-image interpretations. The project created 5 mobile applications (City Oases; MijnPark; Paysages; CropSupport; Natura Alert) and 4 services (Campaigner; Change Detection; Quality Assurance; CropSupport) that contribute to LULC monitoring. Furthermore; LandSense yielded 23 journal publications (290+ citations); and 5 open access datasets (600+ downloads) thereby adding a significant contribution to the scholarship of citizen science; earth observation and LULC monitoring.,https://landsense.eu/

Plan to integrate blockhain as a means of task completion verification,In the city of Heerlen; in the Netherlands; the local government is piloting an application; �Heerlens Heitje� through the European Regional Development Fund Urban Innovative Action (UIA) fund. Through the application; citizens are being rewarded for undertaking public space maintenance tasks such as removing stickers from trash cans or weeding public gardens. The tasks that are included on the app are those which the government does not currently have sufficient funds to procure on a regular basis; it is not intended to replace existing jobs of government employed maintenance workers and contractors. Citizens are paid in a local digital currency which they can use in Heerlen to help stimulate the local economy � See figure 15 for more information. Currently; while still in the development stage; the tasks are linked to addresses and GPS coordinates with photographs; but the next step will be to integrate an embedded map.,,Risks: potential for oppression of job market - replace contracts of existing maintenance workers but steps put in place to avoid this; project success contingent on uptake � must be willing to take on jobs city offers them,Co-delivery of public service enabled through app.,
