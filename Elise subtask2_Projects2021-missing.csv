Using mobile positioning data (passive). People’s mobility is complex; which is why we used over 20 layers of data to create this new network; including data on mobility; planning; bus routes; and land use. Such an approach was chosen to get a thorough overview of where people live; where they go; and how they get from A to B. For example; validation data from electronic bus cards was used to evaluate the actual usage of bus lines; while mobile location data was used to analyse; where people live and work in and around Tartu. Several other data sets were combined with the above-mentioned data; such as information about work and home locations from the Estonian Tax and Customs Board; different data layers from the Land Board; home addresses of school- and kindergarten children; locations of service facilities; and strategic documents concerning transportation and land use planning.,Using multiple data sets (including MPD) to plan a new bus network system in Tartu. ,Included interviews and consultations to verify and add to the findings from the modelling. User-engagement enhanced the serviced delivered.,,One of the project’s goals was to use qualitative data in the form of citizen feedback to complement the quantitative analysis that was based on mobile phone data. When designing complex systems for society it is necessary to understand the users’ point of view as well. The feedback cast light on several socially important aspects that complemented the previous data-driven analysis. For example; early morning buses to Lõunakeskus (a big shopping centre in the outskirts of Tartu) and Tartu prison (also in the outskirts) are important for the people working there; in order to get to work on time. The importance of good; safe connections to schools was emphasised in the planning stages as well. Therefore; for every school; a separate analysis was conducted about where the students live and what the best way for them to get to school would be.

Research paper covering spatial planning in Wallonia. The use of multiple data streams ensures the holistic view of city life. It can serve as an underpinning for more advanced use cases such as digital twins. The sustainable; dynamic and participative solution includes (i) land cover and land use mapping using remote sensing and GIS; (ii) population density mapping using dasymetric mapping; (iii) predictive modelling of land use changes and population dynamics and (iv) risk assessment. Spatial  planning  relies  heavily  on  existing  and  accessible geospatial  data.  Access  to  geospatial  data  in  Wallonia  is heterogeneous. A willingness of data dissemination is currently on-going at the regional level to answer to Inspire (2007/2/EC) and PSI (2003/98/EC; consolidated by 2013/37/EU) directives. Walloon  authorities  have  developed  a geoportal  (WalOnMap (SPW;  2015)) which  give access  to a  large range  of datasets. However the land use land cover map of Wallonia (COSW) has not been updated since 2007. The fact that land use changes in Wallonia varied from –1.5% for agricultural land to +6.2% for urbanized land between 2005 and 2014 shows that data update is essential (IWEPS; 2015). Wallonia;  like  many  other  European  regions;  has  a  remotely sensed data  acquisition framework. Every year a full coverage of  aerial  photos  is  ordered; a  LiDAR  campaign  has recently been performed and a Pleiades coverage over the whole region has  been acquired.  This research  makes use  of these  existing remotely  sensed  data.  Ancillary  geospatial  and  statistical information are integrated in the analysis:  LULC maps; zoning plan; protected areas; networks; soil;  risks and socio-economic datasets. Secondly;  availability;  limited  access;  quality  or semantic  differences  in  existing  data  induce  some  model adaptations  such  as  calibration;  parameters  and/or  validation phases. The main  challenge in  Wallonia  is  the  adaptation  of existing  LU map  to  the  protocol  and  then  defining  the  LU classes  cross semantic between  the  VITO land  use map  for Flanders  (Van Esch et al.; 2011) and the COSW map from 2008 in Wallonia., The comprehensive and long-term vision of the territory should help to draw sustainable spatial planning policies; to adapt remote sensing acquisition; to update GIS data and to refine risk assessment from regional to city scale. Developing  reliable  and  precise land  use classes  and population  distribution  datasets for  analysing and predicting  health  and  environmental  risks,,This project makes use of existing ICT and scientific methods to have  a  common  spatial  planning  model  in  Wallonia  and Flanders.  A national  land-use  change model  is seen  as a key asset  for  sustainable  spatial  planning.  Homogenizing  risks studies  between regions  is intended  since  natural hazards  are not  stopped  by regional  borders.  However; model  replication from one  region to  another is not  straightforward. First of  all different  modelling  goals;  and  geographical  and  social-economic contexts create a need for different parameter sets and scenarios.  Secondly;  availability;  limited  access;  quality  or semantic  differences  in  existing  data  induce  some  model adaptations  such  as  calibration;  parameters  and/or  validation phases. Finally; knowledge of local and  regional LU processes is required.  semantic differences in land use maps between different areas was identified as a challenge in the project,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306920856_Sustainable_and_smart_city_planning_using_spatial_data_in_Wallonia,

The satellite images used were a combination of high-resolution (more expensive); one-shot images from Airbus and low-resolution (free and open source) time-series images from the ESA Sentinel project. Different ML approaches were applied to the two sets of images.

In the implementation phase; NTT DATA used anonymized crop polygons provided by SIAG; retrieving satellite images of the corresponding cultivated fields in the territory of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano. NTT DATA implemented and trained convolutional and recurrent neural network models to model the relationship between satellite images and the types of crops present in the corresponding polygon labels.","Support the disbursement of contributions for agriculture in a more efficient and precise way; in order to allow better management of the provincial budget. Funding contributions from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano act as an important economic incentive for farmers based in South Tyrol. Some provincial contributions vary according to the size of the cultivated area and the type of crop declared by the owner of the farm. The correct allocation of public contributions to farmers living in South Tyrol is therefore an important issue that must be carefully handled to manage public money efficiently.

SIAG; the digital and IT service company of the provincial government; launched the AgriML project to expand control of the type of crops declared on the territory of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano to 100% of the cultivated land.

The second phase of this project involves proposing automations on the control of crop types to verify the correctness of farmers' declarations and subsequent changes in the type of crop. In the future; having these automatic controls available will make it possible for the province to have a proactive control on agricultural land and to anticipate and optimize control activities foreseen by public funding procedures; thus enabling time and cost benefits.",The AgriML project combined competencies and resources from SIAG; NTT DATA; and Microsoft. SIAG was tasked to provide NTT DATA with a sufficient number of polygons containing the type of crops declared by the farms; to accompany the process of creating the prototype so that it reflects the needs of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano; and to evaluate the results obtained. NTT DATA was responsible for selecting the infrastructure and architecture of the ML solution and to implement the solution. NTT DATA used Microsoft Azure Databricks for data-pre-processing and Azure GPU virtual machines. The software code was based on Python; leveraging recent academic papers with codes that were released as open source.,In the prototyping phase; the solution reached 87% classification test accuracy for recurrent neural networks based on temporal low-resolution satellite images and 84% classification test accuracy for convolutional neural networks based on high-resolution satellite images. The next steps will involve continuously improving the algorithms and scaling the solution. The final customer of the application will be the provincial departments of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano; which will carry out a verification check on the types of crop present on fields with apple orchards; vineyards; or grass meadows. The goal is to embed the ML output into the business process; which is based on SAP Grantor Management system.,,,

What would happen to emissions if the temperature in schools was dropped by one degree; or an increase in EV: s by 5 % in the area was achieved? The pilot phase includes approximately 30% of the city’s carbon emission sources.  ,Data sharing: Collaboration between all parties is a quintessential part of the project. The companies and the city are committed to sharing information and offering access to data that has traditionally been held internally. On top of the interface itself; building a collaborative model for the parties involved plays a crucial role.,"Plenty of data is needed for efficient decision-making; such as the scale of emissions from hospitals; schools; transportation and heating; as well as the factors that affect them; but the information is often scattered across different organisations. It’s difficult to estimate the emissions of particular actions beforehand – and so is keeping track of the effectiveness of the changes.

During Reval2020; business owners could use a dedicated web app to see their property valuation and compare their valuation to those of other similar business properties nearby. The solution improved customer service; by giving business owners the ability and the time to check their valuations and raise any queries with LPS before business rate charges were finalised.,,,,https://inspire.spatialni.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page,

Fire prevention is a core function of the Fire & Rescue Service and is the way in which the Council reduces demand on its services and helps to protect its residents. Safe and Well visits are a key part of prevention work; where firefighters make visits to vulnerable residents to decrease the risk of fire in their homes. Previously; assessment data obtained during home visits had been recorded straight onto spreadsheets; an unwieldy and time-consuming process. This also created a challenge for safeguarding purposes: LGTBQ+ data needs to be collected anonymously ensuring that individuals are not identifiable by tracking down their responses to different questions.,,,

Accessible by mobile
device; can navigate to an area and clock for more information.

The real-time devices; powered by the Internet of Things (IoT); will take in all types of data; including water temperatures; tidal conditions; the salinity of the sea; water currents; wind direction and speed; loading and unloading operations; and what berth space is available and when.

The information will be parsed by a program capable of real-time; big data analysis. Central to that examination will be a GIS that gathers; manages; and analyses the port’s data; providing critically needed context. Through maps and simulations of the port’s assets and conditions—for instance; where its gantry cranes are located at a particular moment; or how close a ship is to a quay wall—GIS reveals insights that raw data might not provide; including patterns and relationships in real time. That not only helps port managers run more efficient operations today; it will also serve as a pillar of tomorrow’s world of autonomous ships.

To reach the ultimate goal of being the first port in the world to accept autonomous ships; the Rotterdam team is working to create a digital twin of the port.

Rotterdam’s GIS-powered digital twin would allow port managers to view the operations of all the primary players (see sidebar for more on a port’s operations). It would provide an accurate; current picture of what is going on in the port; everything from the weather to how many ships are sailing about; their speed; and where they are headed. Simulations would be run digitally to improve efficiency and save money in the real port.

Rotterdam officials anticipate being able to pinpoint the best times for ships to berth and offload or take on cargo; because the digital twin simulations will give them the optimal water depths and berth vacancies; among other variables.",Asset management; access to real-time information. Focused on interface between land; water and infrastructure. In the process managed to phase out 29 other systems. Now; more than 1;000 digital maos created each day to guide operations and decision-making. All Port of Rotterdam data presented virtually. Documented outcome: since implementing the new system; the port has seen an increase in throughput to 461 million tons; a 15% increase since 2013.  ,,"Before solution introduced; several legacy systems different employees and assets in silos. 

Going forward: “What the maritime industry of the future will demand is hyper-precise; standardized; secure; and reliable port data with real-time information about the conditions in the port; whether it is the water heights; tidal streams; or wind conditions;” he says.

These up-to-the-second capabilities are similar to what is going on in the realm of autonomous cars. Driverless vehicles need real-time information to keep their passengers safe under changing driving conditions—just as an arriving or departing ship must know exactly what’s happening around it at all times.",,,

Petri Blomqvist. It is an example of best-in-class problem solving initiatives created using
TomTom’s data. This study; based on seven years of data between 2010 and 2017; uses
TomTom Traffic Stats commercial data to measure delay times per kilometre and identify
high-congestion streets or areas throughout the city. Blomqvist’s study was only possible to this extent thanks to the highly granular and precise
data from TomTom Traffic Stats. TomTom’s data is well-suited for any kind of evaluation on
traffic congestion. With Traffic Stats; it is easy to perform city; city section; and street-level
traffic analysis for an accurate understanding of what makes traffic slow down or stop.
Ultimately; this analysis can help cities take measures to reduce congestion and improve
traffic flow. ",,Prior traffic studies were performed by installing probes in three cars that drove through traffic along 14 predefined routes. This probe data was extremely limited and caused problems with variability; as it only measured point studies. In comparison; TomTom Traffic Stats data are based on millions of anonymous probes which are evaluated and analyzed automatically. These data are highly precise and reliable.

Challenges in measuring tourism flows through other means: However; seasonality can have an impact on accommodation statistics. There are other potential issues at play here as well. Many local businesses in Setomaa are so small they are not required to report their visitor numbers. What is more; many domestic tourists might stay with friends and family instead of accommodation establishments; resulting in underreporting of visitors. A survey done by Enterprise Estonia found that 27% of people who plan domestic tourism trips prefer free accommodation.,in Estonia; the national Government uses MPD to monitor the flow of tourists in the country; including their start and end destination; nationality and their length of trip. This data is captured by the Estonian Tourist Board in a Tourism Dashboard; and; at the national level; is used to support strategic planning. The Board also gives access to the dashboard to local and regional tourism organisations to support their planning and operations. For example; in the region of Setomaa; the local tourism organisation has used the dashboard to better understand tourist flows; target marketing and measure the impact of their policies (see figure 19). Before they had access to this data; VisitSetomaa had been relying on accommodation data which did not capture a lot of tourists; as many of the businesses in the rural tourism communities were too small to have to register visitor numbers and many tourists stay in camping vehicles. It is expected that this location intelligence will also drive political value through the promotion of economic development,national tool made available to local governments and to businesses,This is where mobile positioning data (MPD) steps in. In rural tourism communities such as Setomaa; the available statistics might not be as granular or might be misleading decision-makers in the area. ,,,

Overall; the team’s efforts yielded a collection of deep learning models that predicted highway wear and tear; of which the stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model proved to be the most successful at predicting the results largely due to its focus on learning from measurements in both space and time.,"The teams took on the challenge of leveraging road traffic density and road condition data; spanning several time steps between 2009 and 2017; to create a deep learning model that would predict variables representing several indicators of road conditions; such as road roughness and level of crack damage. The goal of the project was to tap into carefully curated time series data collected by the state; and leverage advancements in analytics technology to obtain meaningful predictions of how the highway would experience depreciation over time. This initiative would enable the state to plan predictive road maintenance and invest resources in areas that would most likely be impacted by the effects of use; as well as serve as a proof of concept for potential usage in other parts of the country.

The final results were then published and visualized in ArcGIS Pro; with each road section symbolized to illustrate where road unevenness and cracks would likely develop over time.  Results indicated that curved areas of the highway were the most likely to experience depreciation. These results were also visualized as an animation to show change in road conditions over time; enabling the state department to plan for predictive road maintenance actions and invest resources to ensure smooth highway operations.",,,,,

The CityPulse system thus supposedly knew how many people were walking or biking around on Stratumseind at any time of the day; which bar is the most crowded; how fast persons are moving and who has a suspicious walking pattern.31 The system also performed sentiment analysis of tweets that related to the Stratumseind street – for example; a tweet that was posted from the physical location on the street or mentioned chosen ‘Stratumseind keywords’; such as the street name; a bar on the street or a famous bartender there.,"For example; in the City of Eindhoven in the Netherlands; a CityPulse model was piloted in a street with a high crime rate. The model drew on existing sources of information of pedestrian walking patterns from Closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera; plus additional data from audio sensors; social media data and weather data to provide early warnings to a police control room. The police service then used this information to better target patrols. The city also experimented with other de-escalating techniques such as pre-emptively adjusting the street lighting. While the model was built to ensure citizens were not identifiable; this project also raises important questions of trust; privacy and ethics. 

The main objective of Stratumseind 2.0 was to ‘long-lastingly improve the street from an economic as well as a social point of view’.20 More concretely; the project wanted to attract more visitors; make them stay longer and spend more money in the establishments; lower the vandalism; police and health-related costs in connection to Stratumseind; increase the income related to Stratumseind and Eindhoven as a whole and create positive value of direct marketing.21 These ambitious goals were planned to be achieved through a variety of means and initiatives; especially through ‘a 365 days; 24/7 scan of all data on Stratumseind’.22 The key element and the main sub-project of Stratumseind 2.0 was thus its living lab – the Stratumseind Living Lab (SLL).",Stratumseind 2.0 was an umbrella project in the form of a public-private partnership (PPP) between Eindhoven municipality; the police and a range of private parties; including the Stratumseind establishments association; real-property owners on the Stratumseind street; and Dutch breweries.18 While the notion of PPP has been defined in many ways; we use the broad definition by Savas; understanding a PPP as ‘any arrangement between government and the private sector in which partially or traditionally public activities are performed by the public sector’.19 This definition includes not only long-term cooperation between public and private parties but also short-term and ad hoc cooperation; which is the case in the Stratumseind 2.0 project.,As seen from the description of the initiative; most of the data collected and processed by the living lab seem – at first blush – non-personal. This is connected to the fact that the SLL and similar types of initiatives try to ‘datafy’ public space and the people there through its sensors.52 For this reason; they processes a lot of data that first and foremost relates to the environment (i.e. ‘environmental data’); such as data relating to the weather; amount of beer sold; sound and crowding levels. In this section; we will examine whether data collected and processed within the SLL; which we will call ‘SLL data’; can nevertheless be considered personal.

The municipality of Vilnius launched the Tvarkau Vilniu platform in 2012 in order to streamline the process of gathering information from citizens. Research on the implementation of the Tvarkau app highlighted that; while citizens are often willing to collaborate and provide information; systemic impacts such as building trust and legitimacy only occur if there is a feedback loop in place where citizens can monitor their contribution. Further; from an efficiency perspective; these platforms create a new stream of information for local and regional governments to process. While this provides valuable information; although sometimes of varying quality; the right work streams need to be in place to process this. In line with this; the municipality of Vilnius is considering the introduction of AI and ML to process and prioritize issues; so they react more quickly. ,,The platform makes it much easier to see and act on reported problems; but some replies that look like automated replies are still being sent. Sometimes it happens because the system is big; complicated and some problems go through many other municipal enterprises and end up at the wrong department.,"More than 9000 unique users and almost 82.000 registered problems since 2012. The numbers of registered problems grow each year which shows that the platform is becoming more popular and citizens feel more involved. The growing numbers are challenging; but does increase the efficiency in the work process. Average problem-solving time in Vilnius decreased to approx 14 days.
The platform has also recently been adopted by three other cities in Lithuania (Alytus; Panevėžys and Šiauliai.)",https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118857,https://www.interregeurope.eu/policylearning/good-practices/item/3306/fix-the-city-tvarkau-miesta-city-problem-registry-platform-application/

satellite and converts it to high resolution
ground movement. The Sentinel-1
constellation consists of two radar bearing
satellites; which between them return
to the same orbit every 6 days and
acquire a new radar image. Sophisticated
processing of these images using
proprietary Satsense algorithms; which
build on a technique known as InSAR;
produces detailed maps of ground
movement between satellite passes.
These maps show movement either
towards or away from the satellite and by
combining images acquired from different
geometries; horizontal and vertical motion
can be derived.

Satsense analysed all of the available data from the European Space Agency’s pair of Sentinel-1 satellites (orbiting the Earth at an altitude of almost 700km; 180 degrees apart) over the area of interest in order to build up a more complete picture of the deformation.

This isn’t a new technology – it’s in fact been around since the 1990s; and has transformed scientists’ understanding of everything from the planet’s tectonic fault lines to volcano activity. However; in today’s world; it’s increasingly being used for hazard  management due to its accuracy; cost-effectiveness and remote reporting frequency

The algorithms identify any unusual activity and create alerts for further investigation. The high-quality data which can be gleaned from the technology means that potentially damaging movements in the ground can be spotted and remedied before a safety issue occurs..","SatSense processed Sentinel-1 data over
a site on the Dover to London mainline
near Folkestone. The railway line at this
site crosses one of the largest active
landslides along the English coast;
the deep-seated Folkestone Warren
Landslide; which has had a major impact
on the railway since a major reactivation
in 1915 [3]. Satsense analysed all of
the available Sentinel-1 data from four
different tracks over the area of interest in
order to build up a more complete picture
of the deformation. 

In addition to the average velocities;
SatSense are able to extract detailed
time series for each data point in the
image (Figure 2). These show that the
motion of the Landslide is not steady
in time. SatSense time series are
automatically kept fully up-to-date;
enabling Sentinel-1 data to be used for
operational monitoring of ground stability.

GPS location and orientation parameters (pitch; yaw; roll) were extracted from the EXIF metadata embedded in each image.,Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. UAV or drones) to monitor tourism impacts in protected areas in Jotunheimen National Park. Project demonstrates how drones could help protected area management by monitoring visitor use patterns and commonly associated impacts such as trail condition (width and depth); vegetation structure and disturbances; informal trail proliferation; trampling; and trash and other impacts along the trails. We assessed accuracy and reliability compared with intensive field measurements of impacts and found low-cost drones to be effective in mapping the study area with a resolution of 0.5 cm/pixel: drone derived trail measurements were comparable to traditional measurements with a negligible divergence on trail width measurements and a consistent 1.05 cm divergence on trail depth measurements that can be corrected with a few validation points. In addition; we created a high-resolution vegetation classification map that could be used as a baseline for monitoring impacts. We conclude that drones can effectively contribute to visitor monitoring by reducing time spent in the field and by providing high-resolution time series that could be used as baseline to measure tourism impacts on conservation values in protected areas.,"There is a trade-off between desired resolution and the time required for mapping an area. The final resolution of the orthophoto and DSM is dependent on the camera resolution and the flying altitude (Anderson and Gaston 2013; Puttock et al. 2015): surveys requiring lower resolution can be performed at a higher flight altitude; thus reducing the time needed to survey an area. 

Despite the advantages this method provides; there are several limitations. First; trails have to be directly visible from the air: tree canopy obstructs the direct view; making it impossible to generate an orthophoto. In addition; the legal requirements (i.e. registrations; permits) have to be met before starting the survey. Furthermore; a safe flight plan needs to be in place; where potential risks are assessed. Duffy et al. (2017) summarized a set of guidelines to establish safe and successful drone surveys (Cruzan et al. 2016). Technical challenges are also critical to the success or failure of a survey. Battery life is a key factor; with an approximate flight capacity of 30 min/battery in most consumer-level drones. Such flight time capacity may require landing the drone several times to replace batteries before finalizing a mission; therefore requiring careful planning of safe landing areas to avoid accidents and disturbing visitors or wildlife. Small electric drones show the least disturbance to wildlife; but are nonetheless foreign to the natural landscape and need to be flown with care (Tablado et al. 2017); thus careful observation of stress signals is necessary when flying close to wildlife to adapt; or even stop; the flight mission.",,,

The data model was based upon an international standard under development by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) which informed our approach about bringing data together from disparate organisations and sectors into a common; harmonised structure. This harmonisation will be critical for long term success; and we will be refining the model to ensure it is extensible and allows data to be consistently used.",Vlaio; the Flemish Agency for Innovation & Entrepreneurship developed the so-called Hindrance Premium tool; in collaboration with Information Flanders. The hindrance premium is a financial subsidy for small enterprises who face serious hindrance from roadworks. These enterprises automatically receive a letter from the Flemish administration in case they qualify for a hindrance premium. The automatic selection is based on data from the GIPOD (Generic Information Platform Public Domain); in which all public works in Flanders are registered; and the VKBO (Enriched Crossroads Bank for Enterprises). The unique combination of both databases; supplemented with the open data from GRB; CRAB and the road register; allows a geographical selection of companies that will be affected by planned works. These company can easily request the allowance via an interactive web application. Use case demonstrates a pro-active public service. ,,,,https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC117725,

Every construction and infrastructure project has to source information on buried utility assets such as cables; pipes; sewers and ducts when preparing ground investigation and excavation work. Multiple different organisations have to be contacted with their data delivered in varied formats; scales; quality; and on different timelines. This is hugely inefficient and results in an increased risk of asset strikes with potentially lethal consequences as well as project delays; cost overruns and disruption to traffic and local economies.

The aim of the NUAR pilots was to create a secure data exchange platform to provide a digital map of where assets are located; test its usability and if it can have any impact on the likelihood of asset strikes and project inefficiencies.

Pilot in London and North East of England

Each pilot had approximately 25 participants which clearly demonstrated the high value that high participation can unlock.

4 targeted use cases: safe digging; on-site; site planning; data exchange. ","We believe the current system is unlikely to reform itself as there is no single asset owner who bears the wider societal costs from utility strikes such as potential loss of life; injury; wider project delays and traffic disruption.

The research team also built strong relationships with colleagues operating the VAULT system in Scotland; the KLIP system in Flanders and KLIC system in the Netherlands. Their cooperation and practical advice proved vital throughout the project.

Well-informed; trusted and engaged local stakeholder communities are critical to gaining buy-in for data sharing initiatives - especially as the full benefit of NUAR only arises when everyone participates.

Relationships need to be formed with a common aim and be built on respect for each others’ expertise; approaches and capabilities
Positive engagement with existing initiatives and research was essential to build trust and avoid friction and duplication.

Stakeholders told us that Government involvement was critical in achieving participation from all utility sectors.

We learnt extensively from previous initiatives that have gone before NUAR to pick and use the best approach.
Having 4 clearly defined use cases helped to tell the story about the need for NUAR and reduced scope creep.","Reliable and secure data sharing is also a large-scale coordinated task; requires significant upfront investment and can involve commercial sensitivities; all of which are major barriers to change.  The results from user testing during the NUAR pilot do however indicate that there are limitations to these services which could be addressed through the introduction of a comprehensive digital map showing all underground pipes and cables. In the future there could be potential to integrate the NUAR platform with other utility search and information services.

although only intended as a prototype; the platform adopted a security-minded approach to the disclosure of asset information. Advice was sought from Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI); the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to address national security and asset owners were consulted regarding their commercial and security concerns.
A balance was needed between the need to protect data and to allow access which was done via a “secure by design” approach.
Data sharing agreements were signed between all 35 public and private sector organisations participating in the pilot. This alignment of operational requirement and a risk-based legal approach has been a major milestone for the pilot project.
During the pilots; asset owners continued to own; manage and take decisions on their own data; and any existing positions over liabilities remained the same. This principle is expected to continue through future phases of the programme.","accidental strikes on underground assets are estimated to cost £1.2bn a year in direct and indirect cost.

The pilots also helped to address the Geospatial Commission’s wider programme in a number of areas including:

Data sharing frameworks and mechanisms; particularly between private sector organisations.
Data security and the need to balance security with safety benefits from fewer asset strikes.
Understand the legalities and liabilities with sharing of infrastructure data.
Understand data modelling; specifically how data can best be brought together from both private and public sector organisations and displayed in a single view.",,

collaboration with the various stakeholders. Of course; every target group has
to find a number of needs fulfilled in the solution. Map requesters; utility
companies; local governments and the Flemish government decided on the
needs and the architecture of the solution.

Based on the positive impact of shortening the interpretation of underground
information by ground workers; an agreement was reached on the business

Data from active and passive data collection will be parsed and anonymized.,Data gathered will be used to determine mobility patterns and make urban density and planning improvements e.g.  Suppose a lone bench transmits data indicating that many people congregate by it and spend a long time in its vicinity. Planners might observe that more benches should be installed to accommodate unexpected crowds. By contrast; a bench with low occupancy rates might indicate that its location is inconvenient or obscure; perhaps bench needs cleaning and upkeep or the park it resides in needs maintenance. Then there are the less pleasant considerations that city managers must make: the Bluetooth beacons let the city track its property should it be stolen.
