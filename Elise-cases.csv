Research paper covering spatial planning in Wallonia. The use of multiple data streams ensures the holistic view of city life. It can serve as an underpinning for more advanced use cases such as digital twins. The sustainable, dynamic and participative solution includes (i) land cover and land use mapping using remote sensing and GIS, (ii) population density mapping using dasymetric mapping, (iii) predictive modelling of land use changes and population dynamics and (iv) risk assessment. Spatial  planning  relies  heavily  on  existing  and  accessible geospatial  data.  Access  to  geospatial  data  in  Wallonia  is heterogeneous. A willingness of data dissemination is currently on-going at the regional level to answer to Inspire (2007/2/EC) and PSI (2003/98/EC, consolidated by 2013/37/EU) directives. Walloon  authorities  have  developed  a geoportal  (WalOnMap (SPW,  2015)) which  give access  to a  large range  of datasets. However the land use land cover map of Wallonia (COSW) has not been updated since 2007. The fact that land use changes in Wallonia varied from –1.5% for agricultural land to +6.2% for urbanized land between 2005 and 2014 shows that data update is essential (IWEPS, 2015). Wallonia,  like  many  other  European  regions,  has  a  remotely sensed data  acquisition framework. Every year a full coverage of  aerial  photos  is  ordered, a  LiDAR  campaign  has recently been performed and a Pleiades coverage over the whole region has  been acquired.  This research  makes use  of these  existing remotely  sensed  data.  Ancillary  geospatial  and  statistical information are integrated in the analysis:  LULC maps, zoning plan, protected areas, networks, soil,  risks and socio-economic datasets. Secondly,  availability,  limited  access,  quality  or semantic  differences  in  existing  data  induce  some  model adaptations  such  as  calibration,  parameters  and/or  validation phases. The main  challenge in  Wallonia  is  the  adaptation  of existing  LU map  to  the  protocol  and  then  defining  the  LU classes  cross semantic between  the  VITO land  use map  for Flanders  (Van Esch et al., 2011) and the COSW map from 2008 in Wallonia."," The comprehensive and long-term vision of the territory should help to draw sustainable spatial planning policies, to adapt remote sensing acquisition, to update GIS data and to refine risk assessment from regional to city scale. Developing  reliable  and  precise land  use classes  and population  distribution  datasets for  analysing and predicting  health  and  environmental  risks",,"This project makes use of existing ICT and scientific methods to have  a  common  spatial  planning  model  in  Wallonia  and Flanders.  A national  land-use  change model  is seen  as a key asset  for  sustainable  spatial  planning.  Homogenizing  risks studies  between regions  is intended  since  natural hazards  are not  stopped  by regional  borders.  However, model  replication from one  region to  another is not  straightforward. First of  all different  modelling  goals,  and  geographical  and  social-economic contexts create a need for different parameter sets and scenarios.  Secondly,  availability,  limited  access,  quality  or semantic  differences  in  existing  data  induce  some  model adaptations  such  as  calibration,  parameters  and/or  validation phases. Finally, knowledge of local and  regional LU processes is required.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306920856_Sustainable_and_smart_city_planning_using_spatial_data_in_Wallonia,,,,,
